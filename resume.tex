\section{\faUsers\ Experience}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{\href{https://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/}{Visual \& Data Intelligence Center}}}{ Mar. 2022 - Present}
\role{Undergraduate Researcher}

Developed the \href{https://sites.google.com/view/media2face}{Media2Face}, currently under review at \textbf{SIGGRAPH}. Media2Face can generate highly realistic and expressive 3D facial animations from diverse multimedia inputsâ€”audio, text, and images, trained on the largest ever co-speech 3D facial animation dataset. With Media2face, avatars can now embody complex inner emotions with unprecedented fidelity and versatility in rich multi-muldality guidance.
